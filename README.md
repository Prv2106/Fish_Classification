# Fish_Classification
 The project aimed to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying 15 species of fish using a small annotated dataset and a large unannotated dataset. The main challenge was the limited size of the annotated dataset, which made it difficult to train the model for the classification task. To address this, we explored three different approaches:  Model 1: We used a pre-trained ResNet18 and fine-tuned the classifier on the small annotated dataset. ResNet18 was pre-trained on a large dataset, such as ImageNet, which contains millions of images across thousands of categories. By fine-tuning, we adapted the network to the needs of our smaller dataset.  Model 2: We designed a custom autoencoder with a classifier, leveraging both the annotated and unannotated datasets. The autoencoder was trained on the large unannotated dataset for the reconstruction task, while the classifier was trained on the small annotated dataset. This approach improved classification performance by combining unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification.  Model 3: Using the previously trained autoencoder and classifier, we generated pseudo-labels from the large unannotated dataset. We combined this data with part of the annotated dataset and used it to train a pre-trained ResNet50, then fine-tuned the classifier with the small annotated dataset. This approach combined the strengths of the first two models.  Finally, we compared Model 3 to ResNet18, referring to this experiment as Model 4.  This experience helped us strengthen the knowledge acquired during the course in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, forming a solid foundation for my professional development and fueling my passion for technological innovation.
